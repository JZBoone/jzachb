  h1 My Story
  p I am a software developer and licensed clinical social worker based in San Jose, California. How did I get to be these two very different and seemingly contradictory things? Good question! As a child in the 1990's, "screen time" was not a part of my family's lexicon. For better or for worse I had free reign over the family computer where I frequently spent late nights building websites. Thanks mom and dad!
  p By middle school I had gotten pretty far ahead in math. In 8th grade the high school math class I was going to take didn't fit into my schedule, so they put me in AP computer science. That's how I fell in love with software development. Just kidding! The class was C++ and I didn't like it (although I did manage to eke out a 5 on the AP exam). More than anything, I felt cheated that the class didn't help me get any closer to building something truly cool like the games that I played (and tried to program) on my TI-83 calculator.
  p After declaring as a math major my freshman year in college, I had a beginning of life crisis of sorts. I wasn't passionate about math because it all seemed so abstract and impractical. I ended up transferring to UC Berkeley where I majored in Spanish and Portuguese. The decision to commit to learn Spanish was actually simple. I didn't want to be monolingual and I reasoned that being bilingual would benefit me in whatever profession I ended up choosing.
  p As a newly minted undergraduate, I had a strong desire to help people but no concrete plan. I started volunteering at the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant (EBSC) where I helped immigrants and asylum seekers file federal immigration forms. It was really impactful work and it inspired me to become a social worker. 
  p I couldn't help but try to tackle some of the organizational inefficiences at EBSC. One of the most obvious pain points was how they gathered and reported data on the community development program. The data collection method at the time was done in plane notebooks. Each time the program coordinator met with someone or provided a service of some sort, he would jot down in one of his notebooks the date, who he met with, and the type of service that he provided. When it came time to submit a report to the program funders, he combed through his notebooks and painstakingly compiled the data. "This is inefficient!" I thought. So I spun up a very mediocre Microsoft Access database and installed it on the old Windows network. 
  p As a masters of social work student and intern, I started noticing how I wasn't exactly like all of the other students. Inefficiencies abounded in the world of public mental health. "Productivity" and "compliance" were dirty words that social workers hated to hear, but they were the things that I was most naturally good at. In order to churn out all of the required documentation and paperwork, I developed processes and tools that I started sharing with colleagues. After fine tuning my personal workflows, I started having ideas that were more ambitious and increasingly focused on organizational and systemic inefficiencies.
