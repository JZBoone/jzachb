  h1 My Story
  p I am a software developer and licensed clinical social worker based in San Jose, California. How did I get to be these two very different and seemingly contradictory things? Good question! As a child I was embarrassingly good at math. My well-intentioned mother complained to my elementary school until I had my own math class in the computer lab. Pretty soon my mom was driving me everyday to a middle school to take my math class there. Math came naturally, but my true obsession was building websites. "Screen time" was not a part of my family's lexicon in the 1990's which gave me the freedom to work on my websites late into the night. Thanks mom and dad!
  p In middle school I took high school math classes and even had the privilege of being in the same math class as my older sister and her high school friends. Just kidding, I hated it! In 8th grade the high school math class didn't fit into my middle school schedule, so they put me in AP computer science. That's how I fell in love with software development. Kidding again! The class was C++ and I tolerated it (although I did manage to eke out a 5 on the test). More than anything, I felt cheated that the class didn't help me get any closer to building something truly cool like the drug wars game that I played on my TI-83.
  p Eventually I realized the benefits of tagging along with my older sister. In fact, I followed in her footsteps by attending Boston College and declaring as a math major just like she did. Then it dawned on me. Math isn't cool! What am I doing?! Although I had also declared as a music major (which was definitely cooler than math), I could barely read music. I had an early life crisis of sorts. My thought process went something like this: oh my God, I am going to be stuck as a monolingual English speaker for the rest of my life if I don't do something about it now! I ended up transferring to UC Berkeley where I majored in Spanish.
  p Fast forward to 2008. As a newly minted undergraduate with a degree in Spanish and some landscaping and tutoring experience, I had no idea what to do. I was a bleeding heart liberal steeped in Berkeley culture with a strong desire to help people (and maybe pay down on some of the guilt I had about my own privilege). I started volunteering at the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant (EBSC) where I helped immigrants and asylum seekers file federal immigration forms. It was really impactful work and it inspired me to become a social worker. 
  p While I was there I couldn't help but try to tackle some of the organizational inefficiences at EBSC. One of the pain points at the organization was gathering data on the community development program and reporting this data to the program funders. The data collection method at the time was done in plane notebooks. Each time the program coordinator met with someone or provided a service of some sort, he would write in one of his notebook the date, who he met with, and the type of service that was provided. When he needed to put together a report for the program funders, he would comb through his notebooks to compile the data. "This is inefficient!" I thought. So I spun up a very mediocre Microsoft Access database and installed it on the organization's old Windows machines. It's probably still there gathering dust. In hindsight I see this as an important clue about where I was headed, but at the time I was determined to figure out how to start my career in a helping profession.
